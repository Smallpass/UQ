Java vs Python
Python is an interpreted language, run using the python interpreter. However,
Java is a compiled language, run by first compiling the code into bytecode, then executed.

Hello World:
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello, world");
    }
}

Python checks for type errors while it is runnings (dynamically typed, user input). Java checks 
for error types while it is being compiled (statically typed). 

Printing with:
Java:
if (false) { 
     System.out.println(4 < "5");
    }
    
Python:
    if False:
        print(4<"5")
